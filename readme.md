# Creating Libraries for .NET - Check

This repository contains code related to _Creating Libraries for .NET_ workshop.

It was created so workshop attendees to check if their environments are properly configured before the actual workshop.

In order to do that:

1. clone the repository,
1. open the solution in Visual Studio,
1. build and run the project,
1. the console app shouldn't throw any exceptions and should print out a bunch of todos.
